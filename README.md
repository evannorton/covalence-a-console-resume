# A Console Resume
You will create a resume that exists entirely within the developer console.

## Objectives
* Create a project folder linked to github, and inside that folder an index.html file and a javascript file. Link the JavaScript file to the index.html file.
* Your "resume" will simply be a series of `console.log` statements to print the resume data to the console.
* When you open index.html in the browser, it will be a blank page. That's okay. Your resume will be in the console. (`command + option + I`, or `F12`)
* Your resume should display the following information:
    * Your name
    * Your career/field
    * A short description of yourself
    * A list of your interests
    * A list of your past positions that includes company/place name, title, short description of what you did
    * A list of your skills
* You can make up information if you'd like
* In your skill list, skills that are "cool" should begin with `BAM:`

## Additional Requirements
* Your name should print in all capital letters, but you must not type it as all capitalized in your code (i.e. you will need to use JavaScript to capitalize it)
* You must have a function called `displayPosition` that takes parameters for company name, job title, and description. The function should `console.log` those three items in a format similar to the example below. You will call `displayPosition` several times with different data.
* You must have a function called `displaySkill` that takes parameters for skill name and a boolean value for whether the skill is cool (true/false). Inside the function, you should print `BAM:` in front of the skill name only if the skill is cool. If you don't have any cool skills, make some up.

## Example Output
Your resume output should look similar to this:
